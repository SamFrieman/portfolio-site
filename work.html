                <div class="story-content">
                    During my internship at World Insurance Associates, I got to play detective on a massive scale. 
                    The company was evaluating 40+ potential M&A targets, and my job was to figure out what security 
                    risks might be hiding before deals were finalized.
                    
                    <div class="story-highlight">
                        I leveraged OSINT platforms like Shodan, Censys, and VirusTotal to map out each target's 
                        attack surface. Additionally, I performed daily analysis of client web applications, scrutinizing
                        their security posture through automated vulnerability scans and manual code reviews to identify \
                        potential weaknesses before they could be exploited.
                    </div>

                    Beyond reconnaissance, I performed comprehensive vulnerability assessments, uncovering over 40 
                    critical issues including SQL injection vectors and XSS vulnerabilities. Each finding was 
                    documented and presented directly to the CISO.

                    Analyzing security controls is one thing. Actually assisted implementing them across an enterprise 
                    is where theory meets reality. I helped deploy Microsoft's security stack—Entra ID, 
                    Defender, and Intune.

                    <div class="story-highlight">
                        The challenge wasn't just technical configuration. It was understanding how 300+ 
                        NIST 800-53 controls map to real-world security outcomes. I analyzed the entire framework, 
                        identified identified controls we lacked, and developed a comprehensive remediation roadmap that 
                        theoretically improved security posture by 35%.
                    </div>

                    This wasn't textbook compliance work, rather it was about genuinely making the organization 
                    more resilient against actual threats while maintaining operational efficiency.

                <div class="story-content">
                    At Windward Consulting, I quickly realized that analysts spend enormous amounts of time 
                    on repetitive tasks that could be automated. While reviewing and categorizing 100+ data
                    each week taught me the team's threat taxonomy, I knew there had to be a better way.

                    <div class="story-highlight">
                        I built Python and PowerShell automation scripts that transformed hours of manual CSV 
                        manipulation and report formatting into seconds. The result? Our team saved 3-5 hours 
                        per week that could be redirected toward actual threat analysis.
                    </div>

                    I also conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Nessus and OpenVAS vulnerability platforms across 40+ 
                    scanning techniques to report to the team to help choose the right tool for enterprise adoption.

                    Managing IT infrastructure for a medical practice with 5,000+ patient records taught me that 
                    technical controls are only half the battle. The human element matters just as much.

                        Instead of boring PowerPoint presentations, I created realistic phishing simulations 
                        and hands-on training that showed staff exactly how they were being targeted. The result? 
                        A 60% reduction in successful phishing attempts and zero HIPAA security incidents.
                    </div>

                    I also remediated XSS vulnerabilities and implemented SSL/TLS hardening, leading to a 40% 
                    performance improvement while ensuring strict HIPAA compliance.
